The Warehouse
==================

    My entry for Ludum Dare 31 Compo

Another late night at the warehouse. You are trying to sort the last boxes so you can go home. But the lights are going a bit funny and - wait, what was that? Probably noth- NINJA'D

The Warehouse is a game about mundane work, bad electricity, and ninjas. And, of course, it's all on one screen.

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move.

## Development

To get it running, just pull down the repository and open it in Unity. I *think* it'll work in the Free version; I built it in Pro, but I didn't use any Pro features.
